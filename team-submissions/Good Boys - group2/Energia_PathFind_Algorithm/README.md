# path finding algorithm for ENERGIA / TI-RSLK-MAX

This code implements a resource friendly homebrew path finding algorithm. Before it has any use other than outputting to Serial Console, the motor driver functions have to be added to the individual places

Also, the start- and endpoints are not derived from the robots position, they are hardcoded to prove that the algorithm works without requiring the robot interface itself.

The algorithm is not perfect, because of lack of time, but it works sufficiently enough for demo purposes.
